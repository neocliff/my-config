# Scripts Repository

Useful scripts to automate boring things!

- init-for-re.sh - this script initializes an Ubuntu-ish system
	a bunch of packages that are use for re activities.
	things like compilers, assemblers, etc. this is to support
	Udemy's class "Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development".
	note that this does not download the various toolsets (or
	at least not yet).
- make-key-pair.sh - quick script to use ssh-keygen to make
	a new private keypair and then add it to ssh-agent.
