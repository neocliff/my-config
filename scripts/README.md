# Scripts Repository

Useful scripts to automate boring things!

- init-for-re.sh - this script initializes an Ubuntu-ish system
	a bunch of packages that are use for re activities.
	things like compilers, assemblers, etc. this is to support
	Udemy's class "Reverse Engineering and Exploit Development".
	note that this does not download the various toolsets (or
	at least not yet).
- init-for-re2.sh - this is another script for initializing an
	Ubuntu-ish system with packages useful for re activities.
- make-key-pair.sh - quick script to use ssh-keygen to make
	a new private keypair and then add it to ssh-agent.
- switch-to-kde-plasma.sh - install the KDE Plasma display manager
	on Ubuntu systems (replaces Gnome)
