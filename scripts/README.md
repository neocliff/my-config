# Scripts Repository

Useful scripts to automate boring things!

- init-for-re.sh - this script initializes an Ubuntu-ish system
	a bunch of packages that are use for re activities.
	things like compilers, assemblers, etc.
- make-key-pair.sh - quick script to use ssh-keygen to make
	a new private keypair and then add it to ssh-agent.
